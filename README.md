## Project Overview

This application serves as an interactive platform for building and training neural networks to solve regression and binary classification problems. Users can experiment with different model configurations, train the network, and evaluate its performance. The app also integrates various NLP tasks, enabling users to analyze text data by performing context analysis, extracting keywords, and clustering words based on similarity.

The key feature of this project is its use of custom data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and graphs, which manage the flow of data during training, backpropagation, and NLP tasks.

## Data Structures and Components

### 2.1 Linked List

The **linked list** is at the core of the neural network implementation. It stores the layers of the network in sequence, with each node representing a specific layer. The data contained in each node includes the number of neurons, weights, biases, and activation functions.

- **Insertion of Layers**: Layers are added to the network using the `insert_node` function, ensuring the layers are arranged in the correct order.
- **Forward Propagation**: During forward propagation, the network traverses through each node, passing input through the layers and computing the output.
- **Backward Propagation**: The `backward_propagation` function traverses the linked list in reverse, calculating gradients for each layer to adjust weights and biases.
- **Parameter Update**: Weights and biases are updated after each batch by traversing through the linked list.

### 2.2 Stack

A **stack** is used during backpropagation to store errors that are calculated at each layer. These errors are then used to update the model’s weights and biases.

- **Error Storage**: Errors are pushed onto the stack in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner.
- **Gradient Updates**: Errors are popped off the stack, and gradients are computed to update model parameters.

### 2.3 Queue

The **queue** is used to manage batches of data during training. By splitting the data into smaller subsets (batches), the queue facilitates efficient batch processing.

- **Batch Management**: The queue processes each batch sequentially, ensuring the model trains on multiple subsets of data, improving generalization.

### 2.4 Graph

The **graph** structure is used for NLP tasks. In this graph, words are represented as nodes, and relationships or co-occurrences between words are depicted as edges.

- **Graph Construction**: The graph is built by analyzing text and identifying word relationships based on co-occurrences within a specified window size.
- **Applications**: The graph structure is fundamental for tasks like keyword extraction, word clustering, and context analysis.

## Neural Network Layers

### 3.1 Dense Layer

The **dense layer** is a key component of the neural network. It performs weighted computations on inputs and applies biases to produce output.

- **Weights and Biases**: Each dense layer contains a weight matrix and a bias vector, both of which are updated during training.
- **Forward Function**: The forward function computes the output of the layer.
- **Backward Function**: The backward function calculates gradients for the weights and biases during backpropagation.

### 3.2 Activation Layer

The **activation layer** applies a non-linear activation function (e.g., ReLU or Sigmoid) to the output of the dense layers. This enables the network to learn more complex patterns.

- **Forward Function**: The forward function applies the chosen activation function to the output.
- **Backward Function**: The backward function computes the derivative of the activation function for use during backpropagation.

### 3.3 Loss Functions

Loss functions quantify the difference between predicted and actual outputs, guiding the training process.

- **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)**: For binary classification tasks, BCE is used to calculate the loss and measure the discrepancy between the true labels and predicted outputs.

## NLP Tasks

### 4.1 Context Analysis

Context analysis determines the relationships between words within a sentence or document. The graph structure helps visualize word co-occurrences and interpret the meaning of ambiguous words in context.

### 4.2 Keyword Extraction

Keyword extraction identifies the most significant terms in a text. The app uses graph centrality measures to extract central words that appear in high-frequency clusters. These keywords summarize the document and provide insights into its main topics.

### 4.3 Word Clustering

Word clustering groups words based on semantic similarity. The app employs graph traversal and community detection algorithms (e.g., modularity maximization) to form word clusters that represent similar terms or concepts.

## Supporting Functions

### 5.1 Normalization

Normalization ensures that input data is scaled to a consistent range, which helps the neural network learn effectively. Normalization ensures stable weight updates by preventing features with larger ranges from dominating the learning process.

### 5.2 Batching

Batching splits the dataset into smaller subsets, known as batches. This improves processing efficiency and allows for better generalization during training.

## Driver Code & Frontend

### 6.1 Driver Code

The **driver code** is the central coordinator of the system. It integrates all the components — layers, data structures, and NLP tasks — to ensure smooth training, evaluation, and text processing. The driver code handles user input, initializes the network, and orchestrates forward and backward propagation.

### 6.2 Frontend (Streamlit)

The **Streamlit frontend** offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application. Users can input parameters such as the number of layers, learning rate, batch size, and more. The frontend also provides options to visualize intermediate results, adjust configurations, and evaluate model performance in real-time.

## User Interaction and Flow

### 7.1 Model Training

1. **Input Data**: Users provide datasets for regression or classification tasks.
2. **Model Configuration**: Configure model parameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, etc.
3. **Training**: The neural network is trained using forward and backward propagation, updating weights and biases after each batch.
4. **Loss Calculation**: The app displays the current loss during training and updates the parameters based on gradients.

### 7.2 NLP Analysis

1. **Text Input**: Users input a text for NLP analysis.
2. **Select Task**: Choose between context analysis, keyword extraction, or word clustering.
3. **Process and Display**: The app processes the text, analyzes word relationships, and visualizes the results (e.g., clusters, keywords).

### 7.3 Performance Evaluation

1. **Model Accuracy**: After training, users can evaluate the model's accuracy using metrics such as classification accuracy or mean squared error (for regression).
2. **Prediction**: Users can input new data for real-time predictions, with the app providing predicted values based on the trained model.
